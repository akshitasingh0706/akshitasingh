## ABOUT ME

I am a UC Berkeley alum who is pursuing MS in Computer Science at UC Irvine. Currently researching with Amir Rehmani's Health SciTech Group at the intersection of Machine Learning and Healthcare. Before this, I worked at Accenture (Clients: Google, Facebook, Airbnb) as a Data Architect and Data Scientist. I am interested in applying Machine Learning to solve multiple Healthcare problems. I am also looking for opportunities in the Applied Research and ML Engineering space. Contact: akshitasingh@berkeley.edu
