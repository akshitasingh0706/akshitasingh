## ABOUT ME

I am a UC Berkeley alumna who is pursuing MS in Computer Science at UC Irvine. I am currently researching with Amir Rehmani's Health SciTech Group at the intersection of Machine Learning and Healthcare. Before this, I worked at Accenture (Clients: Google, Facebook, Airbnb) as a Data Architect and Data Scientist. I am interested in applying Machine Learning to solve multiple Healthcare problems. I am also looking for opportunities in the Applied Research, Data Science and ML Engineering space. Contact: akshitasingh@berkeley.edu

At the Health SciTech group, I have worked on developing personalized Machine Learning models (using algorithms Multi-Task Learning, Multi-Kernel Learning, Heirarchical Bayesian Inferences, and Least Squares Support Vector Machines) to predict mental health amongst college students. I also work on finding appropriate clusters to group different personalities using statistical and probabilistic methods such as Dynamic Time Warping, Box plots, and ANOVA. 

As Data Science consultant at Google I worked with 3 different Google teams. I implemented marketing data pipelines to track email to product conversions. Through iterative and balanced A/B testing techniques, I helped reduce churn by 5-10% on different Google products. I also helped construct Machine Learning models to assign health scores to our customers which helped predict our at-risk audience well in advance.
